                                         A_Fragment - Android Documentation App

A clean and simple Android application demonstrating the use of Fragments and Dynamic UI Navigation within a single activity.

🚀 Overview
This project is designed to showcase how to manage multiple views efficiently using Android Fragments. Instead of creating multiple activities, this app uses a single MainActivity and swaps different fragments into a FrameLayout container.

✨ Features
Single Activity Architecture: Optimized performance by using a single main activity.
Dynamic Fragment Switching: Smooth transition between different screens (Click1, Click2, Click3).
Modern Layout Design: Combined use of RelativeLayout for alignment and LinearLayout for structured button groups.
Custom Backgrounds: Visual distinction for each fragment state.

🛠 Tech Stack
Language: Java
IDE: Android Studio
UI Components: FrameLayout, RelativeLayout, LinearLayout, and Buttons.

📸 Screenshots
The app features a bottom navigation style where clicking a button replaces the content in the top container.
